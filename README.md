# Forked from pixento/broadcast-to-mqtt
The original project did not have an apk published and the Google Play link is dead. It is such a handy little app, so I compiled it myself and published it on this Github repo.

I do not intent to update or maintain this app. This repo exists only to share the apk with the world.

Download the apk from the Releases page: https://github.com/Kaassouffleetje/broadcast-to-mqtt/releases

# Original readme:
# broadcast-to-mqtt
Android app which sends broadcast intents to a MQTT broker.

## Installation
Install the app from the play store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pixento.nl.broadcasttomqtt

## Collaboration
Please note that this application is developed in free time, so support is limited.

If you found a bug or have a feature request, please create an issue.
Pull requests are greatly appreciated and should point to the `develop` branch.
